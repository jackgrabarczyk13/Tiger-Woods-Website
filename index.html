   Tiger Woods is a pro golfer. Tiger Woods was born in
    Cypress, California, in 1975. He won the U.S. Masters at 
    Augusta in 1997 with a record score at age 21, making 
    him the youngest man and the first African American to 
    earn the title. Woods won another 13 majors and was 
    named the PGA Player of the Year 10 times over the next 
    12 years, but he struggled to regain his top form after 
    personal problems surfaced in 2009. With his victory at
    the 2019 Masters, Woods claimed his first major title in 
    nearly 11 years.
